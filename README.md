# 3DAeroRelief: The First 3D Benchmark UAV Dataset for Post-Disaster Assessment
3DAeroRelief is a high-resolution 3D point cloud dataset designed to benchmark semantic segmentation algorithms in post-disaster scenarios.

# Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized into 8 distinct areas, along with configuration files for reproducibility and helper code for preprocessing the data.
- `Area_<n>/`: Contains the 3D data for each location.
    - `pp<n>.ply`: The raw RGB 3D point cloud (Geometry + Texture).
    - `segmentpp<n>.ply`: The associated label.
- `ColmapConfig/`: Contains the specific COLMAP configuration files used to generate the reconstructions.
- `code/`: Python utility scripts for data handling.
- `labels.txt`: List of semantic class names and IDs.

## Classes
The dataset classifies points into distinct semantic categories (e.g., Undamaged Building, Damaged Building, Background). Refer to labels.txt for the complete list of class mappings.
